This is a repository for me to keep track of my Jupyter notebooks as I am in the process of learning about computer vision and image processing. 

Some of the notebooks are adapted from exercises (originally written for Matlab) from my computer vision seminar at school. Others are just personal projects. 

All of the sample images in the img/ folder are in the public domain.
